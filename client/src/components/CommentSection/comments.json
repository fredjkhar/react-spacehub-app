        "comment": "When black holes or neutron stars collide, they produce pretty strong gravitational waves, and if you somehow stood close enough, you would hear them. You would also immediately become a diffuse mass of unrecognizable and likely exotic matter, because you stood, in astronomical terms, right next to a supernova-scale catastrophic event. Would not recommend."
